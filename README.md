# Firewall Administration Project

## üìå Business Case
Establish a robust firewall administration framework to protect the organization‚Äôs network infrastructure from unauthorized access, data exfiltration, and cyber threats. This project ensures secure traffic flow, enforces access control policies, and supports compliance with regulatory standards.

---

## üéØ Project Objectives
- Deploy and configure firewalls across all network zones
- Define and enforce granular access control policies
- Monitor, audit, and optimize firewall performance
- Integrate firewall logs with SIEM for real-time threat detection

## üßæ Licensing Requirements

| Firewall Type             | Licensing Model                          | Notes                                                  |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Hardware Firewalls        | Per device or throughput-based           | E.g., Cisco ASA, Palo Alto, Fortinet                   |
| Virtual Firewalls         | Per VM or cloud instance                 | E.g., Azure Firewall, AWS Network Firewall             |
| Next-Gen Firewalls (NGFW) | Feature-based or subscription bundles    | Includes IPS, SSL inspection, app control, etc.        |
| Centralized Management    | Per admin console or device count        | E.g., Panorama, FortiManager, Cisco FMC                |

**Recommendations:**
- Choose NGFWs for deep packet inspection and app-layer controls
- Ensure licenses cover high availability (HA) and failover scenarios
- Consider cloud-native firewalls for hybrid or multi-cloud environments

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Workflow

1. **Initiate Project**
   - Define scope: perimeter, internal segmentation, cloud zones
   - Identify stakeholders: network, security, compliance teams

2. **Network Assessment**
   - Map current topology and data flows
   - Identify critical assets and trust boundaries

3. **Firewall Policy Design**
   - Define inbound/outbound rules, NAT policies, and VPN access
   - Align with Zero Trust and least privilege principles

4. **Firewall Selection & Procurement**
   - Evaluate vendors based on performance, features, and support
   - Procure hardware/software and validate licensing

5. **Deployment Planning**
   - Design HA pairs, failover paths, and change windows
   - Document rollback plans and communication protocols

6. **Implementation**
   - Install and configure firewalls per design
   - Apply baseline rule sets and enable logging

7. **Testing & Validation**
   - Conduct connectivity, failover, and rule validation tests
   - Simulate attacks to verify detection and blocking

8. **Monitoring & Logging**
   - Forward logs to SIEM (e.g., Splunk, Sentinel)
   - Set up alerts for policy violations and anomalies

9. **Policy Review & Optimization**
   - Remove unused rules and shadowed policies
   - Tune performance and reduce false positives

10. **Documentation & Training**
    - Document rule sets, change procedures, and escalation paths
    - Train network and security teams on firewall operations

11. **Ongoing Administration**
    - Schedule rule reviews and firmware updates
    - Conduct quarterly audits and compliance checks

---

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

- Use object groups and naming conventions for clarity
- Apply deny-all default policies with explicit allow rules
- Segment networks with internal firewalls or VLANs
- Enable logging for all critical rules
- Regularly review and prune stale rules
- Use change control for all firewall modifications
- Encrypt management access (SSH, HTTPS)
- Monitor CPU/memory usage and throughput
- Test backups and configuration restores
- Align firewall rules with business applications

---

## üìã Project Management Tips

- Assign firewall change windows to minimize downtime
- Track rule change requests via the ticketing system
- Maintain a firewall rule review board
- Align firewall strategy with NIST, ISO, or CIS frameworks
- Periodically benchmark firewall performance

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Workflow

1. **Initiate Project**
   - Define scope (internal, external, cloud assets)
   - Identify stakeholders: IT, Security, Compliance

2. **Environment Preparation**
   - Inventory assets and IP ranges
   - Identify scanning targets (servers, endpoints, network devices)

3. **Install Nessus**
   - Download and install Nessus on a secure scanning host
   - Activate license and configure admin account

4. **Configure Scan Policies**
   - Create custom scan templates (e.g., credentialed, web app, compliance)
   - Define scan schedules and asset groups

5. **Credential Management**
   - Set up secure credentials for authenticated scans
   - Use vault integration if available (e.g., CyberArk, HashiCorp)

6. **Initial Scans**
   - Run baseline scans across all asset groups
   - Validate scan results and adjust configurations

7. **Vulnerability Triage**
   - Prioritize findings based on CVSS, exploitability, and asset criticality
   - Assign remediation tasks to appropriate teams

8. **Remediation Workflow**
   - Integrate with ticketing systems (e.g., Jira, ServiceNow)
   - Track remediation SLAs and verify fixes with re-scans

9. **Reporting & Dashboards**
   - Generate executive and technical reports
   - Share dashboards with stakeholders for visibility

10. **Integration**
    - Connect Nessus with SIEM (e.g., Splunk, Sentinel) for alert correlation
    - Feed data into CMDB or asset inventory tools

11. **Training & Documentation**
    - Train IT and security teams on interpreting Nessus results
    - Document scanning procedures and remediation playbooks

12. **Ongoing Operations**
    - Schedule recurring scans (weekly/monthly)
    - Tune scan policies and update plugins regularly

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

- Use credentialed scans for deeper visibility
- Segment scanning by asset type or business unit
- Regularly update Nessus plugins and software
- Validate remediation with follow-up scans
- Avoid scanning during peak business hours
- Use tagging to organize assets by criticality
- Monitor scan health and performance
- Document all exceptions and risk acceptances
- Align findings with MITRE ATT&CK and CIS Benchmarks
- Periodically review scan scope and policies

---

## üìã Project Management Tips

- Assign a dedicated vulnerability management lead
- Track metrics: time to detect, time to remediate, scan coverage
- Conduct monthly vulnerability review meetings
- Align with compliance frameworks (e.g., PCI-DSS, ISO 27001, NIST)
- Use risk-based prioritization to focus on high-impact issues
