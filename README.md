# Nessus Vulnerability Management Project

## üìå Business Case
Establish a proactive vulnerability management program using Nessus to identify, assess, and remediate security weaknesses across the enterprise. This project aims to reduce the attack surface, ensure compliance, and improve overall cyber resilience.

---

## üéØ Project Objectives
- Deploy and configure Nessus for enterprise-wide vulnerability scanning
- Establish a repeatable vulnerability assessment and remediation workflow
- Integrate Nessus with ticketing and SIEM tools for streamlined operations
- Provide actionable reporting for IT, security, and compliance teams

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Workflow

1. **Initiate Project**
   - Define scope (internal, external, cloud assets)
   - Identify stakeholders: IT, Security, Compliance

2. **Environment Preparation**
   - Inventory assets and IP ranges
   - Identify scanning targets (servers, endpoints, network devices)

3. **Install Nessus**
   - Download and install Nessus on a secure scanning host
   - Activate license and configure admin account

4. **Configure Scan Policies**
   - Create custom scan templates (e.g., credentialed, web app, compliance)
   - Define scan schedules and asset groups

5. **Credential Management**
   - Set up secure credentials for authenticated scans
   - Use vault integration if available (e.g., CyberArk, HashiCorp)

6. **Initial Scans**
   - Run baseline scans across all asset groups
   - Validate scan results and adjust configurations

7. **Vulnerability Triage**
   - Prioritize findings based on CVSS, exploitability, and asset criticality
   - Assign remediation tasks to appropriate teams

8. **Remediation Workflow**
   - Integrate with ticketing systems (e.g., Jira, ServiceNow)
   - Track remediation SLAs and verify fixes with re-scans

9. **Reporting & Dashboards**
   - Generate executive and technical reports
   - Share dashboards with stakeholders for visibility

10. **Integration**
    - Connect Nessus with SIEM (e.g., Splunk, Sentinel) for alert correlation
    - Feed data into CMDB or asset inventory tools

11. **Training & Documentation**
    - Train IT and security teams on interpreting Nessus results
    - Document scanning procedures and remediation playbooks

12. **Ongoing Operations**
    - Schedule recurring scans (weekly/monthly)
    - Tune scan policies and update plugins regularly

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

- Use credentialed scans for deeper visibility
- Segment scanning by asset type or business unit
- Regularly update Nessus plugins and software
- Validate remediation with follow-up scans
- Avoid scanning during peak business hours
- Use tagging to organize assets by criticality
- Monitor scan health and performance
- Document all exceptions and risk acceptances
- Align findings with MITRE ATT&CK and CIS Benchmarks
- Periodically review scan scope and policies

---

## üìã Project Management Tips

- Assign a dedicated vulnerability management lead
- Track metrics: time to detect, time to remediate, scan coverage
- Conduct monthly vulnerability review meetings
- Align with compliance frameworks (e.g., PCI-DSS, ISO 27001, NIST)
- Use risk-based prioritization to focus on high-impact issues
